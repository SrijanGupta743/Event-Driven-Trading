# Event-Driven-Trading
Crawled the Business Times for any article related to Facebook, mined the texts, and fetched the overall
sentiment for each day. We can buy ten shares of the stock if the sentiment increases by 0.5 or sell if it decreases by 0.5. The sentiment
ranges from -1 to 1, with 0 being neutral; we use the previous dayâ€™s sentiment to trade in the current day.
